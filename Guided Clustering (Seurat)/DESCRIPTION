Description: Pipeline for Guided CLustering in Seurat

The scRNA-seq data used from Tucker et. al. is publicly available here: 
https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP498/transcriptional-and-cellular-diversity-of-the-human-heart#study-download

The pipeline for guided clustering using Seurat is split into 3 main steps:
1. Pre-processing.R - Pre-processing of scRNA-seq data for QC
2. Guided clustering.R - Performing guided clustering using Seurat R package
3. Output.R - Visualising guided clustering results and identification of heart cell-types

The complete steps for scRNA-seq clustering can be found in Compiled clustering steps.R.
